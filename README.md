# Dog
Udacity Capstone project

Welcome to the dog breed classifier project. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. 

# Dog_Breed Classifier

In this project I have made a CNN or convolutinal neural network that can classify images of dogs from images given by the user with an accuracy of almost 84%.

## Project Instructions
### Instructions
Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
git clone https://github.com/udacity/dog-project.git
cd dog-project
Download the dog dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/dogImages.

Download the human dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/lfw. If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder.

Donwload the VGG-16 bottleneck features for the dog dataset. Place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/bottleneck_features.

(Optional) If you plan to install TensorFlow with GPU support on your local machine, follow the guide to install the necessary NVIDIA software on your system. If you are using an EC2 GPU instance, you can skip this step.

(Optional) If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS), create (and activate) a new environment.

Linux (to install with GPU support, change requirements/dog-linux.yml to requirements/dog-linux-gpu.yml):
conda env create -f requirements/dog-linux.yml
source activate dog-project
Mac (to install with GPU support, change requirements/dog-mac.yml to requirements/dog-mac-gpu.yml):
conda env create -f requirements/dog-mac.yml
source activate dog-project
NOTE: Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV

conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
Windows (to install with GPU support, change requirements/dog-windows.yml to requirements/dog-windows-gpu.yml):
conda env create -f requirements/dog-windows.yml
activate dog-project
(Optional) If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS) and Step 6 throws errors, try this alternative step to create your environment.

Linux or Mac (to install with GPU support, change requirements/requirements.txt to requirements/requirements-gpu.txt):
conda create --name dog-project python=3.5
source activate dog-project
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
NOTE: Some Mac users may need to install a different version of OpenCV

conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
Windows (to install with GPU support, change requirements/requirements.txt to requirements/requirements-gpu.txt):
conda create --name dog-project python=3.5
activate dog-project
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
(Optional) If you are using AWS, install Tensorflow.

sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements/requirements-gpu.txt
Switch Keras backend to TensorFlow.

Linux or Mac:
 KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
Windows:
 set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
 python -c "from keras import backend"
(Optional) If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS), create an IPython kernel for the dog-project environment.

python -m ipykernel install --user --name dog-project --display-name "dog-project"
Open the notebook.
jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb
(Optional) If you are running the project on your local machine (and not using AWS), before running code, change the kernel to match the dog-project environment by using the drop-down menu (Kernel > Change kernel > dog-project). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.
